# Before and After: APIs for Split Admins

A new Postman collection with API examples for the five Split Admin API endpoints that will be replaced by Harness API endpoints during the Split-to-Harness migration. Each folder includes an overview section with detailed guidance tailored for both experienced Split administrators and those new to Split and Harness FMEâ€”to support a smooth and well-prepared transition for you.
